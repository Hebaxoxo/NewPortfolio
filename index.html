        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <br>
        <p>My name is Heba, I am <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #e976a2;" href="https://eurestella.web.app">Eurestella</a>'s CEO, and I'm a 16-year-old with a strong passion for programming, writing, and video editing. I consider myself a curious learner, always seeking new knowledge and skills to expand my horizons. Currently, I am enrolled in DECI (Digital Egyptian cups initiative), where I'm honing my abilities and exploring various creative avenues.

            From a young age, I have been captivated by the world of programming. The ability to bring ideas to life through coding fascinates me, and I constantly strive to improve my skills in languages like C++ and Python. Problem-solving is at the core of my approach, as I enjoy tackling challenges and finding innovative solutions.
            
            Writing has been a significant part of my life since I was six years old. It provides me with a creative outlet to express my thoughts, ideas, and emotions. Through my writing, I aim to connect with readers, inspire them, and leave a lasting impact. Whether it's storytelling or informative content, I find joy in crafting words that resonate with others.
            
            In addition to programming and writing, video editing is another avenue where I can unleash my creativity. I find joy in combining visuals, sound, and storytelling elements to create engaging and impactful videos. Software tools like Adobe After Effects, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Premiere Pro are my trusted companions in this creative journey.
            
            As a curious learner, I am eager to explore new realms, challenge myself, and embrace opportunities for growth. I believe that continuous learning and adapting to new technologies and trends are essential in the ever-evolving digital landscape.</p>
